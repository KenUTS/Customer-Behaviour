This initiative aims to develop a model to predict whether an existing customer will purchase a new car. 

This model's output will be used to target potential customers in a marketing campaign. 

More specifically, the marketing team might employ the model to find clients who are more likely to purchase a new car and target those individuals. 

It can improve the marketing campaign's effectiveness by preventing the team from wasting efforts on customers who are unlikely to make a purchase.
